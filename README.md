# Spatial Distribution of High School Standardized Test Performance 

This project is an updating prototype of ML model-estimation of the spatial distribution of high school standardized test score performance. We gather and combine average score performance (SAT and ACT) at the high-school level for 10 states in total. We also gather test counts and participation rates, as these are known nuisance parameters, but they have yet to be implemented in this analysis. They are also missing in some states; we impute them if that is the case.
